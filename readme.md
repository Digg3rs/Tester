Download the latest beta version by clicking [here](https://github.com/DukeLupus/QuickList/releases/download/v3-beta.5/QuickList.v3.beta5.zip), see also the [Releases](https://github.com/DukeLupus/QuickList/releases) page for older versions and changes.

### Installation

1. Open OmenServe\ListMagic folder - usually &lt;mirc folder&gt;\OmenServe\ListMagic
2. [Optional] Rename existing QuickList.exe to something else, in case you want to revert to v2
3. Put new, v3 QuickList.exe to  OmenServe\ListMagic folder
4. [Optional] Double-click QuickList.exe, to make sure everything works. You should see message "Commandline parameter pointing to ini file is missing!", this is expected
5. Make and manage lists in OmenServe same as always


### Changes & new features
* Optional partial folders in the public list, reducing chances of leaking personal info. This strips the initial input portion of the folder from the list.  
	E.g. if the list input folder is "c:\Users\Scott\Files\Books\" then instead of including folder name "c:\Users\Scott\Files\Books\William Shakespeare\Plays", public list only includes "William Shakespeare\Plays" as a folder name.
* Much, much faster list generation, especially for very large non-media lists
* Much faster list generation with the cached media info
* More accurate matching of the cached vs actual media file information
* Support for more media types: aa, aac, aax, aif, aiff, ape, asf, avi, divx, dsf, fla, flac, m2a, m2v, m4a, m4b, m4p, m4v, mka, mks, mkv, mp+, mp1, mp2, mp3, mp4, mpc, mpe, mpeg, mpg, mpp, mpv2, oga, ogg, ogv, opus, wav, webm, wma, wmv, wv.
* Supports additional media types with shell integration (shell aka Windows Explorer must be capable of showing the media duration and additional info. This may require an installation of specific codecs/codec packs): g2, 3gp, act, alax, amd, awb, dct, dss, dvf, f4a, f4b, f4v, flv, m4a, mov, mts, mts2, qt, vob
* Exclude files by filename, not just extension


### Advanced
QuickList v3 creates section [QuickList] in the ListMagic .ini file (the one you can open from QuickList UI). While most of the configuration can be controlled from the UI, there are some advanced keys which cannot be controlled from UI.
- **ForceShellMedia** - default value 0 (ForceShellMedia=0), set to 1 to use Windows Shell instead of taglib# for getting the media info. This is considerably slower, but can be more accurate (depends on installed codecs).
- **FileReaderParallelism** - default value 1 (FileReaderParallelism=1). Increase this to enable multi-threading of file and media info gathering. This should only be increased for SSD drives, and will slow down list generation on regular ATA hard drives. Using larger numbers than CPU core count is not recommended.
- **ExcludedFilenames** - exclude from list by filename, colon-separated (defaults to "desktop.ini:thumbs.db")
